My name is Hao Zhang. I'm an undergraduate research assistant working with [Prof.Adrian Perrig](https://netsec.ethz.ch/people/aperrig/) at ETH Zurich. Before I  worked with [Prof.Shyam Gollakota](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/) at University of Washionton. I have also spend sometime at National University of Singapore and Amazon AI. My research focuses on:

1. Building real-time and theoretically-sound sensing and human-device interaction systems on wearable devices.<br>

2. Wireless sensing and IoT security.<br>
