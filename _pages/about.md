Iâ€™m Hao Zhang, currently a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have previously collaborated with [Prof. Adrian Perrig](https://netsec.ethz.ch/people/aperrig/)  at ETH Zurich as a research staff member and worked with  [Prof. Shyam Gollakota](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~gshyam/) at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington. I have also contributed to research projects at the National University of Singapore and Amazon AI. My research interests include:

1. LLM for tiny devices.<br>

2. Wireless sensing.
